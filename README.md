# cs50-final

For my CS50x final project, I wanted to create a website that was actually useful for myself. As a senior looking into colleges and qualifying AP credit, I had difficulties making a quick query on college board. They have all the content, but are lacking the elegance of a query for multiple colleges and/or AP exam test scores. 

Not to mention, college board's website is lame. I added spice to collegiate life.
